## Loading and preprocessing the data
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
daily.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN = sum)
hist(daily.steps)
mean.daily.steps <- mean(daily.steps, na.rm = TRUE]
median.daily.steps <- median(daily.steps, na.rm = TRUE]

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
daily.activity.pattern <- tapply(data$steps, data$interval, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(rownames(daily.activity.pattern), daily.activity.pattern, type = "l")

## Imputing missing values
total.na <- sum(is.na(data$steps))



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
